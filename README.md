Use the filter method to create a new array called evenSquares that contains only the even squares from the squares array.
Use destructuring assignment to extract the first and second elements of the evenSquares array into constants firstEvenSquare and secondEvenSquare.
Use a template literal to log the original numbers array, the squares array, the evenSquares array, and the extracted even squares.
